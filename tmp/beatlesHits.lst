YELLOW SUBMARINE
WE CAN WORK IT OUT
WHAT YOU ARE DOING
WHEN I GET HOME
WITH A LITTLE HELP FROM MY FRIENDS
WOMAN
YOU HAVE GOT TO HIDE YOUR LOVE AWAY
WHEN I AM SIXTY FOUR
TWIST AND SHOUT
ROCKY RACCOON
LOVE ME DO  
FROM ME TO YOU  	
SHE LOVES YOU 
I WANT TO HOLD YOUR HAND  
CANT BUY ME LOVE  	
A HARD DAY'S NIGHT  
I FEEL FINE  	
TICKET TO RIDE  
HELP  
DAY TRIPPER  	
MY GUITAR GENTLY WEEPS
WE CAN WORK IT OUT
